\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:hermes:intro}

In this chapter, we present the \hermes software suite---a collection of
programs aimed at evaluating the kinetic properties of RNA molecules.
Provided a coarse-grained energy landscape generated by \ffttwo (described
in Chapter \ref{ch:ffttwo}), we present software which computes both the \mfpt
and \eqt for this discretized energy landscape. We also provide software which
computes the exact kinetics for an RNA molecule, however since this requires
exhaustive enumeration of all secondary structures---which is known to be an
exponential quantity for the length of the RNA in consideration---the full
kinetics are not expected to be practical for anything beyond a sequence of
trivial length. The software in \hermes presents a practical application of
the energy landscapes computed by the \ffttwo algorithm. Contrasted against
the other kinetics software in the field, \hermes offers similar accuracy
with unparalleled performance which opens up the possibility for large-scale
kinetic analysis {\em in silico}, which we expect to be of use for synthetic
design.

\subsection{Organization}
\label{subsec:hermes:org}

This chapter is organized in the following fashion. We begin by providing
background on the state-of-the-art approaches for kinetic analysis of RNAs.
From there, we move into a technical discussion of two traditional approaches
for kinetics, computation of the \mfpt and the \eqt. With this foundation in
place, we proceed to discuss the high-level organization of the \hermes
software package, and describe in detail each of the four underlying programs
which comprise the kinetics suite. We then move on to present comparitive
benchmarking of \hermes against other methods, before finally concluding with
some remarks on the accuracy and applicability of \hermes to computational
RNA design.
