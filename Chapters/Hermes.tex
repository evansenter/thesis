\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:hermes:intro}

In this chapter, we present the \hermes software suite---a collection of
programs aimed at evaluating the kinetic properties of RNA molecules.
Provided a coarse-grained energy landscape generated by \ffttwo (described
in Chapter \ref{ch:ffttwo}), we present software which computes both the \mfpt
and \eqt for this discretized energy landscape. We also provide software which
computes the exact kinetics for an RNA molecule, however since this requires
exhaustive enumeration of all secondary structures---which is known to be an
exponential quantity for the length of the RNA in consideration---the full
kinetics are not expected to be practical for anything beyond a sequence of
trivial length. The software in \hermes presents a practical application of
the energy landscapes computed by the \ffttwo algorithm. Contrasted against
the other kinetics software in the field, \hermes offers similar accuracy
with unparalleled performance which opens up the possibility for large-scale
kinetic analysis {\em in silico}, which we expect to be of use for synthetic
design.

\subsection{Organization}
\label{subsec:hermes:org}

This chapter is organized in the following fashion. We begin by providing
background on the state-of-the-art approaches for kinetic analysis of RNAs.
From there, we move into a technical discussion of two traditional approaches
for kinetics, computation of the \mfpt and the \eqt. With this foundation in
place, we proceed to discuss the high-level organization of the \hermes
software package, and describe in detail each of the four underlying programs
which comprise the kinetics suite. We then move on to present comparitive
benchmarking of \hermes against other methods, before finally concluding with
some remarks on the accuracy and applicability of \hermes to computational
RNA design.

\section{Traditional approaches for kinetics}
\label{sec:hermes:kinetics}

To better understand the underlying algorithms behind the software,
we describe two traditional approaches in kinetics.

\subsection{\Mfpt}
\label{subsec:hermes:mfpt}

Consider a physical process,
which when monitored over time, yields the stochastic sequence
$q_0,q_1,q_2,\dots$ of discrete, observed states. If the transition from
state $q_t$ to $q_{t+1}$ depends only on $q_t$ at time
$t$ and not on the historical sequence of prior states visited,
as often assumed in the case of protein or
RNA folding, then a Markov chain provides a reasonable
mathematical model to simulate the process.

A (first-order, time-homogeneous)
{\em Markov chain} $\mChain = (Q,\pi,P)$ is given by a finite
set $Q = \{ 1,\dots,n \}$ of states, an initial probability distribution
$\pi = (\pi_1,\dots,\pi_n)$, and the $n \times n$
{\em transition probability matrix} $P = (p_{i,j})$.
At time $t=0$, the initial state of the system is
$q_t=i$ with probability $\pi_i$, and at discrete time
$t=1,2,3,\dots$, the system makes a transition from state
$i$ to state $j$ with probability $p_{i,j}$; i.e.
the conditional probability $Pr[ q_{t+1} = j | q_t=i] = p_{i,j}$.
Define the {\em population occupancy frequency} of visiting state
$i$ at time $t$ by $p_{i}(t) = Pr[q_t=i]$.  Denote
$p_{i,j}^{(t)} = Pr[q_t = j | q_0 = i]$ and notice that
the $(i,j)$-th entry of the $t$-th power $P^t$ of matrix $P$  equals
$p_{i,j}^{(t)}$.

The {\em \mfpt} (MFPT) or
{\em \hit} for the Markov chain \mChain,
starting from initial state \xStart and proceeding
to the target state \xEnd, is defined
as the sum, taken over all paths $\rho$
from \xStart to \xEnd, of the path length $\textit{length}(\rho)$
times the probability
of path $\rho$, where $\textit{length}(\rho_0,\dots,\rho_n)$ is defined to
be $n$. In other words,
${\text MFPT} = \sum_{\rho} Pr[\rho] \cdot \textit{length}(\rho)$, where
the sum is taken over sequences $\rho=\rho_0,\dots,\rho_n$ of states
where $\rho_0=\xStart$ and $\rho_n=\xEnd$, and no state is visited more
than once in the path $\rho$.

Given the target state \xEnd, MFPT can be exactly
determined by computing the inverse
$(I - P^{-}_{\xEnd})^{-1}$, where $I$ is the $(n-1)\times (n-1)$ identity
matrix and $P^{-}_{\xEnd}$
denotes the $(n-1)\times (n-1)$ matrix obtained from the
Markov chain transition probability matrix $P$,
by deleting the row and column with index \xEnd.
Letting ${\bf e}$ denote the
$(n-1) \times 1$ column vector consisting entirely of $1$'s, it can be
shown that \mfpt from state \xStart to state \xEnd
is the \xStart-th coordinate
of column vector
$(I - P^{-}_{\xEnd})^{-1} \cdot {\bf e}$ \cite{meyerMFPT}.

The {\em stationary} probability distribution \statDist
is a row vector such that $\pSt \cdot P = \pSt$; i.e.
$\pSt_j = \sum_{i}^n \pSt_i \cdot p_{i,j}$, for all $1\leq j \leq n$.
It can be shown that the stationary probability $\pSt_i$ is the limit,
as $m$ tends to infinity, of the frequency of visiting state $i$ in a
random walk of length $m$ on Markov chain \mChain.
It is well-known that the stationary distribution exists and is unique
for any finite aperiodic irreducible Markov chain \cite{cloteBackofen:book}.

The Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm \cite{metropolis:MonteCarlo} can
be used to simulate a random walk from initial state \xStart to target state
\xEnd, when energies are associated with the states, as is the case in
macromolecular folding, where free energies can be determined for
protein and RNA conformations from mean field theory, quantum theory,
or experimental measurements. In such cases, a {\em move set}
defines the set $N_x$ of conformations reachable in unit time
from conformation $x$, and the transition probability matrix
$P = (p_{x,y})$ is defined as follows:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hermes:mfptXitionProb}
p_{x,y} =
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{|N_x|} \cdot \min\left( 1, \boltzYmX \right)
& \text{if $y \in N_x$} \\
1 - \sum_{k \in N_x} p_{x,k} & \text{if $x=y$} \\
0 & \text{if $y \not\in N_x$, and $x \ne y$} \\
\end{cases}
\end{align}

If $\pSt_x \cdot p_{x,y} = \pSt_y \cdot p_{y,x}$ holds for all distinct
$x,y \in Q$, then
{\em detailed balance} is said to hold, or equivalently the Markov
chain \mChain is said to be {\em reversible}.
If transitional probabilities
are defined as in equation (\ref{eq:hermes:mfptXitionProb}), and if neighborhood
size is constant ($|N_x|=|N_y|$ for all $x,y$), then it is well-known
that the stationary probability distribution
\statDist is the Boltzmann distribution; i.e.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hermes:stationaryBoltzmannProb}
\pSt_k = \frac{\boltzf{k}}{Z}
\end{align}

where $E(k)$ is the energy of conformation $k$ at temperature $T$,
$R$ is the universal gas constant,
$T$ is absolute temperature, and the {\em partition function}
$Z = \sum_{k=1}^n \boltzf{k}$ is a normalization constant
\cite{waterman:book,cloteBackofen:book}. If neighborhood size is not
constant, as in the case where states are RNA secondary structures and transitions
are restricted to the addition or removal of a single base pair, then
by {\em Hasting's trick}, an equivalent Markov chain can be defined which
satisfies detailed balance -- see equation (\ref{eq:hermes:MFPTwithHastings}).

Following Anfinsen's experimental work on the denaturation and
refolding of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease \cite{anfinsen},
the native conformation is assumed to be the ground state having
minimum free energy. These results justify the use of the Monte Carlo
Algorithm \ref{algo:MonteCarlo} in macromolecular kinetics and
structure prediction.

The \mfpt from state $x$ to state $y$ can
be approximated by repeated runs of the Monte Carlo algorithm.
In particular, \v{S}ali, Shakhnovich, and Karplus used such Monte Carlo
simulations to investigate the Levinthal paradox of how a protein
can fold to its native state within milliseconds to seconds.
By repeated Monte Carlo simulations using a protein lattice model,
\v{S}ali et al. observed that a large energy difference between
the ground state
and the first misfolded state appears to be correlated with fast folding.

\subsection{\Eqt}
\label{subsec:hermes:eq}

A continuous time {\em Markov process} $\mChain=(Q,\pi,P(t))$
is given by a finite set $Q= \{1,\dots,n\}$ of states, the
initial probability distribution $\pi$,
and the $n\times n$ matrix $P(t)=(p_{i,j}(t))$ of
probability transition functions.

% \footnote{Only in the
% current section does $P(t)$ denote the Markov process
% transition probability matrix.  In all later sections of the paper,
% $P(t) = (P_1(t),\dots,P_n(t))$ will denote the population occupancy
% frequency function, defined in (\ref{eq:hermes:populationOccupancyEquation}).
% In Markov processes, the rate matrix $R$ is used rather than the transition
% probability matrix $P(t)$, so there will be no ambiguity in later
% reserving $P(t)$ to denote the population occupancy function.}

Letting $q_t$ denote the state at (continuous)
time $t$, the probability that the initial state $q_0$ at time $0$ is
$k$ is $\pi_k$, while

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hermes:markovProcess}
p_{i,j}(t) = Pr[q_{t} = j| q_0 = i].
\end{align}

The matrix $P'(t)$ of derivatives, defined by

\begin{align}
  P'(t) = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{d p_{1,1}}{d t}(t) & \dots  & \frac{d p_{1,n}}{d t}(t)\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
 \frac{d p_{n,1}}{d t}(t) & \dots  & \frac{d p_{n,n}}{d t}(t)\\
\end{array}
\right),
\end{align}

can be shown to satisfy

\begin{align}
P'(t) = P(t) \cdot R
\end{align}

where $R = (r_{i,j})$ is an $n \times n$ {\em rate matrix} with the
property that each diagonal entry is $-1$ times the row sum

\begin{align}
r_{i,i} = - \sum_{j\ne i} r_{i,j}.
\end{align}

Define the {\em population occupancy} distribution
$p(t) = (p_1(t),\dots,p_n(t))$ by

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hermes:markovProcessPopulationFreq}
p_i(t) = Pr[q(t) = i] = \sum_{k=1}^n\pi_k p_{k,i}(t)
\end{align}

where $q(t)$ denotes the state of the Markov process
at (continuous) time $t$.

In the case of macromolecular folding, where Markov process states
are molecular conformations and conformational energies are available,
it is typical to define the rate matrix
$R = (r_{x,y})$ as follows:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hermes:eqXitionRate}
r_{x,y} =
\begin{cases}
\min\left( 1, \boltzYmX \right)
& \text{if $y \in N_x$} \\
-\sum_{k \in N_x} p_{x,k} & \text{if $x=y$} \\
0 & \text{if $y \not\in N_x$, and $x \ne y$} \\
\end{cases}
\end{align}

The {\em master equation} is defined by the matrix differential equation

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hermes:masterEquationMatrix}
\frac{d p(t)}{dt} = p(t) \cdot R
\end{align}

or equivalently, for all $1 \leq x \leq n$,

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hermes:masterEquation}
\frac{d p_x(t)}{dt} = \sum_{y=1}^n\, (p_y(t) \cdot r_{y,x} - p_x(t) \cdot
r_{x,y})\; = \sum_{x \ne y}\, (p_y(t) \cdot r_{y,x} - p_x(t) \cdot r_{x,y}).
\end{align}

As in the case of Markov chains,
\statDist is defined to be
the stationary distribution if
$\pSt \cdot P(t)= \pSt$; i.e. $\pSt_k = Pr[ q(0) = k ]$ implies that
$Pr[ q(t) = k] = \pSt_k$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and
$1 \leq k \leq n$.
Define the {\em equilibrium distribution} \statDist
to be the unique solution for $p(t)$, when the master equation
(\ref{eq:hermes:masterEquation}) is set to equal zero; i.e.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hermes:equilibriumTime}
\sum_{x \ne y} \pSt_x \cdot r_{x,y} = \sum_{x \ne y} \pSt_y \cdot r_{y,x}.
\end{align}

If the equilibrium distribution exists, then necessarily it is equal to
the stationary distribution. A Markov process is said
to satisfy detailed balance if $\pSt_x \cdot r_{x,y} = \pSt_y \cdot r_{y,x}$,
for all $1 \leq x,y \leq n$, where the rate matrix $R = (r_{x,y})$.

The rate equation $R$ for is usually defined
as in (\ref{eq:hermes:eqXitionRate}) for
Markov processes which model macromolecular folding,
hence it is easy to see that
such Markov processes satisfy detailed balance and moreover that
the equilibrium distribution is the
Boltzmann distribution; i.e.  $\pSt_x = \boltzf{x}$ for
all $1 \leq x \leq n$.
Since detailed balance ensures that the eigenvalues of the rate matrix $R$ are
real, one can solve the matrix differential equation
(\ref{eq:hermes:masterEquation}) by diagonalizing the rate matrix, and thus obtain
the solution

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hermes:populationOccupancyEquation}
p(t) = \sum_{k=1}^n c_k {\bf v}_k e^{\lambda_k t}
\end{align}

where $p(t) = (p_1(t),\dots,p_n(t))$, and the
values $c_k$ are determined by the initial population occupancy
distribution $p(0)$ at time $0$. Here
${\bf v}_k$ denotes the $k$th eigenvector and
$\lambda_k$ the $k$th eigenvalue. In particular,
$c_k = \left(p(0) \cdot T^{-1})\right)_k$, where the $j$-th row of $T$
is the $j$-th left eigenvector of $R$,
and $p(0)$ is the population occupancy distribution
at time $t=0$. If the eigenvalues are labeled in decreasing
order, then $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n$,
and the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1=0$ has eigenvector \pSt, corresponding
to the equilibrium population occupancy distribution, which in this case
is the Boltzmann distribution. The
remaining $n-1$ eigenvalues are negative, and their corresponding eigenvectors
correspond to nonequilibrium kinetic {\em relaxation modes}.

In our software \hermes, we prefer to work with column vectors and
right eigenvectors due to our usage of the GSL scientific computing library,
and so the population occupancy frequency
$p(t)$ is defined to be the column vector
$p(t)=(p_1(t),\dots,p_n(t))^{\text T}$. Let
$\mathbbt^1,\dots,\mathbbt^n$ be the right eigenvectors and
$\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$ be the corresponding right eigenvalues of the
transpose $R^{\text T}$ of the rate matrix.
Letting $T$ be the $n\times n$ matrix, whose columns are
$\mathbbt^1,\dots,\mathbbt^n$, using standard matrix algebra
\cite{matrixTheory}, it can be shown that

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hermes:solutionMasterEquation}
p(t) = \sum_{j=1}^n (T^{-1}
\mathbbP(0))_j \cdot \mathbbt^j \cdot e^{\lambda_j t}
\end{align}

The {\em \eqt} can be directly computed by using a
nonlinear solver to solve for $t$ in

\begin{align}
\label{eq:hermes:solutionEquilibriumTime}
\pSt = \sum_{j=1}^n (T^{-1}
\mathbbP(0))_j \cdot \mathbbt^j \cdot e^{\lambda_j t}
\end{align}

where $\statDist^{\text T}$ and $\pSt_k = \frac{\boltzf{k}}{Z}$.
However, we have found it more
expedient to compute the {\em \eqt} as the smallest $t_0$,
such that for $t \in \{t_0+1,t_0+2,t_0+3,t_0+4\}$, the absolute difference
$|p(t)[\xEnd] - p(t_0)[\xEnd]| < \epsilon$, for $\epsilon =
10^{-4}$, where \xEnd is the target RNA structure (usually taken
to be the minimum free energy structure, though this is not necessary for
the software). We also considered defining the \eqt to be the
smallest $t_0$, such that for $t \in \{t_0+1,t_0+2,t_0+3,t_0+4\}$, the
absolute difference $|p(t)[x] - p(t_0)[x]| < \epsilon$ for all $x \in
Q$; however, results suggest that this definition is inferior
to that just given, perhaps due to numerical instability issues when
$Q$ is taken to be the set of all secondary structures for sequences in
the benchmarking set described later.

In \cite{gillespieStochasticSimulation1} Gillespie described
a very influential algorithm to simulate a finite Markov process.
The pseudocode, is given in Algorithm \ref{algo:Gillespie}.
Though Gillespie's original application was for chemical kinetics,
Flamm et al. adapted the method for the kinetics of RNA secondary structure
folding, as implemented in \kinfold \cite{flammPhD,flamm}.

\section{Software within the \hermes suite}
\label{sec:hermes:layout}

The \hermes software package was developed on the Macintosh OS X
operating system (10.9.2 and 10.10) and should work with any Unix-like platform
(Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS were tested). We make the source code freely
available under the MIT License in two locations.
Our lab hosts the latest stable version of the code at
\url{http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/Hermes} and a fully
version-controlled copy at \url{https://github.com/evansenter/hermes}.
The data and figures presented in this article were generated with the
source code hosted at the first URL, and we make no guarantee as to
the stability of development branches in our Git repository.

External dependencies for the software include a C [resp. C++]
compiler supporting the GNU99 language specification [resp. C++98],
FFTW implementation of Fast Fourier Transform \cite{FFTW05} ($\geq
3.3.4$) \url{http://www.fftw.org/}, Gnu Scientific Library GSL ($\geq
1.15$) \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/}, Vienna RNA Package
\cite{Lorenz.amb11} ($\geq 2.0.7$) \url{http://www.viennarna.at}, and
any corresponding sub-packages included with the aforementioned
software. For a more detailed explanation of both external
dependencies and installation instructions, refer to the
`DOCS.pdf' file at the web site
outlining the configuration and compilation process for the \hermes
suite.

\hermes is organized into three independent directories: (1)
\ffttwo, (2) \rnamfpt, and (3) \rnaeq (see
Figure \ref{fig:hermes:organizationHermes}). These packages compile into both
standalone executables and archive files. The archives provide a DRY
API which allow the development of novel applications using source
from across the \hermes package without having to copy-and-paste
relevant functions. We provide two such examples of this in the {\tt
ext} subdirectory: \fftmfpt and \ffteq. These applications
are simple C drivers that use functions from \ffttwo, \rnamfpt and
\rnaeq to replicate a pipeline of executable calls without having to
deal with intermediary data transformation, I/O between calls or
slow-down due to a scripting language driver such as Python or R.

\begin{figure}[!h]

without having to copy-and-paste relevant functions. The applications
\fftmfpt and \ffteq are C drivers that use data structures and functions from
\ffttwo, \rnamfpt and \rnaeq. \fftmfpt computes the mean first
passage time (MFPT) for an RNA secondary structure to fold from an
initial structure, such as the empty structure or a given metastable
structure, into a target structure, such as the minimum free energy
(MFE) structure or possibly the Rfam \cite{Gardner.nar11} consensus
structure. \ffteq uses spectral decomposition to compute the equilibrium time and the
fraction of the population of RNA structures that are
equal to a given target structure, as a function of time.

\subsection{Exact \mfpt with \rnamfpt}
\label{subsec:hermes:rnamfpt}

\rnamfpt computes the {\em \mfpt} (MFPT), sometimes
referred to as the {\em \hit} of a Markov chain, by using
matrix inversion \cite{meyerMFPT} --- see
Section~\ref{section:algo}. The program takes as input a
comma separated value (CSV) file containing the non-zero positions and
values of a 2D probability grid; i.e. a CSV format file having columns {\em i},
{\em j}, and {\em p}. The first two columns, {\em i} and {\em j}
correspond to the {\em 0-indexed} row-ordered position in the rate
matrix and the final column {\em p} is the probability $p_{i,j}$
of a transition from {\em i} to {\em j}.  From this input, the
\mfpt is constructed by matrix inversion.
Because this program was designed with the original intent
of handling 2D-probability grids, all vertexes are uniquely identified
by index tuples (which conceptually correspond to positioning in a 2D
array). However, it is trivial to use this code with both
1D-probability grids such as those produced by \fftbor
\cite{Senter.po12} or arbitrary transition matrices without any change
to the underlying implementation. The software additionally provides
many options for defining the structure of the graph underlying the
Markov chain. Some of these include the option to force a fully
connected graph (useful in cases where there is no non-zero path
between the start / end state) or to enforce detailed balance.
Finally, \rnamfpt also accepts as input the probability transition matrix,
a stochastic matrix with row sums equal to $1$, and computes the mean
first passage time for the corresponding Markov chain.

\subsection{Approximate \mfpt with \fftmfpt}
\label{subsec:hermes:fftmfpt}

\fftmfpt approximates the \mfpt of a given RNA
sequence folding from input structure A to B, by {\em exactly}
computing the \mfpt from state $(0,d_0)$ to state
$(d_0,0)$ in the 2D probability grid obtained from running
\ffttwo. Here, $d_0$ is the base pair distance between structures
$A,B$, and the MFPT is computed for the Markov chain, whose states are
the non-empty 2D probability grid points, and whose transition
probabilities are defined by $p_{(x,y),(x',y')} =
\frac{P(x',y')}{P(x,y)}$. As we report in this paper, given an RNA
sequence $\seq$, if $A$ is the empty structure and $B$ the MFE
structure of $\seq$, then \fftmfpt output is well correlated with the
exact MFPT in folding the empty structure to the MFE structure, where
transitions between structures involve the addition or removal of a
single base pair.

\subsection{Exact \eqt with \rnaeq}
\label{subsec:hermes:rnaeq}

\rnaeq computes the population proportion of a user-provided structure
over arbitrary time units. Like \rnamfpt, this program takes as input a
comma separated value (CSV) file containing the non-zero positions and
values of a 2D probability grid. From this input a rate matrix
is constructed for the underlying Markov process. Alternatively,
\rnaeq can accept as input an arbitrary rate matrix. Performing
spectral decomposition of the column-ordered rate matrix that
underlies the corresponding Markov process, \rnaeq computes either
the \eqt or population occupancy frequencies.
Additionally, \rnaeq can call the
Vienna RNA Package program \rnasub \cite{Wuchty.b99}, with a
user-specified upper bound to the energy difference with the minimum
free energy. With this option, the rate matrix is
constructed for the Markov process, whose states consist of all
the structures returned by \rnaeq, and the \eqt or
population occupancy frequencies are computed. Due to the time
and memory required for this option, we do not expect it to be used except for
small sequences.

\subsection{Approximate \eqt with \ffteq}
\label{subsec:hermes:ffteq}

\ffteq allows an investigator to efficiently estimate population
kinetics for a sequence folding between two arbitrary, but fixed,
structures. The transition rate matrix underlying the Markov process
necessary for eigendecomposition is derived from the 2D-energy
landscape. Vertices in the rate matrix represent a subset of
structures compatible with the input sequence as modeled by
\ffttwo, which makes the graph size more tractable than structural
sampling with \rnasub, even with constraints.

\subsubsection{Population occupancy curves with \ffteq}
\label{subsubsec:hermes:popcurve}

version 2.1.7 of {\tt RNAfold -d0}, is {\tt

energy $-7.5$ kcal/mol. In the case of the MFE structure, the
equilibrium occupancy $P(t_{\infty})$, which \hermes approximates
as $0.17893806$ should equal the Boltzmann probability $0.17909227$,
since the MFE structure is the only structure at distance $x_0$ [resp.
$y_0$] from the reference structures $A$ (empty
structure) [resp. $B$ (MFE structure)]. As well, if there are few
other low energy structures at the same base pair distance $x_1$
[resp. $y_1$] from $A$ [resp. $B$] as that of the alternate suboptimal
structure, then we expect that the occupancy probability $0.03003426$
for the $(x_1,y_1)$ be approximately the Boltzmann probability
$0.03005854$ of the alternate structure.}

\subsubsection{Approximating \eqt from occupancy curves}
\label{subsubsec:hermes:eqestimate}

The computation of an \eqt value from the eigendecomposition of the rate matrixis a rather thorny issue. (something about the non-linear solver approach not working, same as in FFTbor w/ numeric instability)

\section{Correlations of kinetics data across software}
\label{sec:hermes:corr}

\subsubsection{Benchmarking data for computational comparison}
\label{subsubsec:hermes:benchdata}

In this section, we describe a
benchmarking set of 1,000 small RNAs used to benchmark the previously
described kinetics methods in a comparative study. To ensure that mean
first passage time can be computed from
$(I - P^{-}_{\xEnd})^{-1} \cdot {\bf e}$ by using matrix
inversion, that spectral decomposition of the rate matrix is possible,
and to ensure that \kinfold simulations would provide sufficient
statistics, we generated a collection of 1,000 random RNA sequences of
length 20 nt, each having expected compositional frequency of $1/4$
for A,C,G,U, and each having at most 2,500 distinct secondary
structures, such that the minimum free energy is less than or equal to
$-5.5$ kcal/mol.

For example, one of the 1,000 sequences is ACGCGACGUGCACCGCACGU with
minimum free energy structure {\tt .....((((((...))))))} having free
energy of $-6.4$ kcal/mol. Statistics for the free energies of the
2,453 secondary structures of this 20-mer are the following: mean is
$10.695$, standary deviation is $4.804$, maximum is $25.00$, minimum
is $-6.40$. A histogram for the free energy of all secondary
structures of ACGCGACGUGCACCGCACGU is depicted in
the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:hermes:plmv}. The right panel of the
same figure depicts the minimum free energy structure of the
54 nt hammerhead type III ribozyme from Peach Latent Mosaic Viroid
(PLMVd), discussed later. This secondary structure is identical
to the consensus structure from Rfam 11.0 \cite{Gardner.nar11}.

Vienna RNA Package 2.1.7 with energy parameters from the Turner 1999
model were used, since the minimum free energy structure determined by
the more recent Turner 2004 energy parameters
does {\em not} agree with the Rfam consensus structure --- see
\cite{syntheticHammerheads}. Positional entropy, a measure
of divergence in the base pairing status at each positions for the
low energy ensemble of structures, is indicated by color, using the

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:hermes:kinfoldMeanStdev} displays the mean
and standard deviation for \kinfold simulations of folding time
for each of the 1,000 RNA sequences from our benchmarking data. For
each sequence, the mean and standard deviation of the time required to
fold the empty structure to the MFE structure were computed from
10,000 \kinfold runs, each run with an upper bound of $10^8$
Monte Carlo steps, thus ensuring that all simulations converged. The
sequences were then sorted by increasing folding time mean. Standard
deviation exceeded the mean in $83.9\%$ of the 1,000 cases, indicating
the enormous variation between separate \kinfold runs, even for
20 nt RNA sequences having at most 2,500 secondary structures. In our
opinion, \kinfold is an expertly crafted implementation of
Gillespie's algorithm for an event driven Monte Carlo simulation of
one-step RNA secondary structure folding. From the standpoint of
biophysics and physical chemistry, there is no more reliable
simulation method, except of course the exact computation of mean
first passage time using linear algebra. Nevertheless, the enormous
time required for reliable \kinfold estimations and the large
standard deviations observed point out the need for a faster method to
approximate folding time.

Note the close fit to the exponential distribution, {\em (Right)} Mean minus standard deviation ($\mu -\sigma$), mean ($\mu$), and mean plus standard deviation ($\mu + \sigma$) of the logarithm of \kinfold folding times, taken over 10,000 runs for each of the 1,000 sequences from the benchmarking set of 20-mers. For graphical illustration, we have sorted the log folding times in increasing order.}

\subsubsection{Pearson correlation coefficients for various kinetics packages}
\label{subsubsec:hermes:corrtable}

In this section, we display the correlation between (1) the {\em gold
standard} method \rnamfpt, both with and without the Hastings
modification using equations (\ref{eq:hermes:MFPTwithHastings}) and
(\ref{eq:hermes:MFPTwithoutHastings}), (2) the {\em platinum standard} method {\tt
Equilibrium}, (3) the {\em silver standard} method \kinfold, (4) {\tt
FFTmfpt} with and without the Hastings modification using equations
(\ref{eq:hermes:transitionProbabilityFFTbor2DwithHastings}) and
(\ref{eq:hermes:transitionProbabilityFFTbor2DwithoutHastings}), (5) \ffteq
which computes \eqt for the 2D-grid, (6) \rnatwofold
with and without the Hastings modification using equations
(\ref{eq:hermes:transitionProbabilityFFTbor2DwithHastings}) and
(\ref{eq:hermes:transitionProbabilityFFTbor2DwithoutHastings}). Correlations
with [resp. without] the Hastings modification are summarized in the
lower [resp. upper] triangular portion of
Table~\ref{table:correlation}. It is clear that correlations between
the mathematically exact methods \rnamfpt, \rnaeq, and
approximation methods \kinfold, \fftmfpt, \ffteq, \rnatwofold are
improved when using the Hastings correction.

Figures~\ref{fig:hermes:scatterplotRnaEqVsRnaMfptHastingsAndKinfold},
\ref{fig:hermes:scatterplotRnaMfptHastingsVsKinfoldAndFftMfpt},
\ref{fig:hermes:scatterplotFftMfptVsKinfoldAndFftEq}
depict scatterplots for kinetics obtained by some of the algorithms
above. The left panel of
Figure \ref{fig:hermes:scatterplotRnaEqVsRnaMfptHastingsAndKinfold}
shows a scatter plots for gold standard \rnamfpt versus platinum
standard \rnaeq, with correlation value 0.5652. The right
panel of the same figure shows a scatter plot for \kinfold versus
\rnaeq, with correlation 0.7814. Note the persence of two
clusters in this and some of the other scatter plots. Cluster A
consists of RNA sequences whose folding time, as determined by \rnamfpt
or \rnaeq, is rapid --- specifically, the natural
logarithm of the MFPT is at most 7.5. Cluster B consists of the
remaining RNA sequences, whose folding time is longer than that of
cluster A. There are no significant differences between RNA sequences
in clusters A and B with respect to GC-content, sequence logo, minimum
free energy, number of secondary structures, etc.  The left panel of
Figure \ref{fig:hermes:scatterplotRnaMfptHastingsVsKinfoldAndFftMfpt}
shows the scatter plot for \rnamfpt versus \kinfold, with
correlation 0.7933, and the right panel shows the scatter plot for
\rnamfpt versus \fftmfpt, with correlation 0.6035.
Figure \ref{fig:hermes:scatterplotFftMfptVsKinfoldAndFftEq}
shows scatter plots for \fftmfpt versus \kinfold {\em (Left)} and
for \fftmfpt versus \ffteq {\em (Right)}, with respective
correlation values 0.7608 and 0.9589. \kinfold obviously provides
a better correlation with the exact value of \mfpt;
however, since the standard deviation of \kinfold runs is as
large as the mean,\footnote{It follows from spectral decomposition that
\eqt follows an exponential distribution (or sum of
exponential distributions). Exponential distributions have the property
that the mean is equal to the standard deviation, hence
it is not surprising that \kinfold
kinetics have this property.} accurate kinetics estimates
from \kinfold require prohibitively large computational time --- indeed, in
\cite{wolfingerStadler:kinetics} reliable kinetics for phe-tRNA from
yeast were obtained by 9,000 \kinfold simulations, each for $10^8$
steps, requiring 3 months of CPU time on an Intel Pentium 4 running at
2.4 GHz under Linux. Although the correlation value of 0.6035 between
\rnamfpt and \fftmfpt is much less than that obtained by {\tt
Kinfold}, the runtime required by our method \fftmfpt is measured
in seconds, even for moderate to large RNAs. For this reason, we
advocate the use of \fftmfpt in synthetic biology screens to
design RNA sequences having certain desired kinetic properties. Once
promising candidates are found, it is possible to devote additional
computational time to \kinfold simulations for more accurate
kinetics.
