Jaque Fresco, Paul Doty => 1959 RNA as graph theoretic
There are only a select set of possible base pairs (clarify that select set of commonly occuring)
coarsified => partitioned

Meanwhile other groups have used covariance model (CM)-based approaches to find aptamer domains, most notably CMfinder [35] and Rfam [36].

    This isn't really true, RFam is a DB, not a finder

While pseudoknots have been shown to be present in some biologically relevant RNAs, their inclusion greatly complicates the recursive decomposition of the structure, and thus it is common to ignore them.

    Discuss biological implications of no supporting pseudoknots, as well as what biological significant RNAs are impacted by this omission
