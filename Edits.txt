FIXED:
comprised of => composed of
Jaque Fresco, Paul Doty => 1959 RNA as graph theoretic
There are only a select set of possible base pairs (clarify that select set of commonly occuring)
coarsified => partitioned
Meanwhile other groups have used covariance model (CM)-based approaches to find aptamer domains, most notably CMfinder [35] and Rfam [36]. (This isn't really true, RFam is a DB, not a finder)
Cut mention of experimental validation
Ribosomal machinery vs. RNA pol. for expression platform in 2.3.1.2
kcal / mol / K
Add in the organisms for anything that I have accession number indices for
DONE: While pseudoknots have been shown to be present in some biologically relevant RNAs, their inclusion greatly complicates the ive decomposition of the structure, and thus it is common to ignore them.
"no sequence homology according" => "no sequence identity according"
Figure 4.7 make sure that the labels are correct (right panel twice)
reasonable mathematical model to simulate the process (Reasonable because there exists no respository of experimentally derived kinetics)

NOT NECESSARY:
Lemma 3.2, 4.3 can go
Semilog to spread figures out for FFTbor2D benchmarking figures
Make sure that the legend doesn't override the graph
Indicate that those RNAs in group 1 (scatterplots) are generally the same

OUT OF SCOPE:
Also talk about non-canonical base pairs and their implications
pH jump experiments increase non-canonical base pair diversity
Discussion of the ramifications of investigating biologically relevant rnas without considering cofactors
Download RFam Hammerhead and don't provide family number
Talk about de novo search vs. homology search
