      and web server to identify {R}{N}{A} riboswitches. The
      Riboswitch finder analyses a given sequence using the web
      interface, checks specific sequence elements and secondary
      structure, calculates and displays the energy folding of
      the {R}{N}{A} structure and runs a number of tests
      including this information to determine whether
      high-sensitivity riboswitch motifs (or variants) according
      to the Bacillus subtilis type are present in the given
      {R}{N}{A} sequence. Batch-mode determination (all sequences
      input at once and separated by FASTA format) is also
      possible. The program has been implemented and is available
      both as local software for in-house installation and as a
      web server at

      increasing number of riboswitches have been identified in
      different species and investigated for their roles in
      regulatory functions. Both the sequence contexts and
      structural conformations are important characteristics of
      riboswitches. None of the previously developed tools, such
      as covariance models (CMs), Riboswitch finder, and RibEx,
      provide a web server for efficiently searching homologous
      instances of known riboswitches or considers two crucial
      characteristics of each riboswitch, such as the structural
      conformations and sequence contexts of functional regions.
      Therefore, we developed a systematic method for identifying
      12 kinds of riboswitches. The method is implemented and
      provided as a web server, RiboSW, to efficiently and
      conveniently identify riboswitches within messenger
      {R}{N}{A} sequences. The predictive accuracy of the
      proposed method is comparable with other previous tools.
      The efficiency of the proposed method for identifying
      riboswitches was improved in order to achieve a reasonable
      computational time required for the prediction, which makes
      it possible to have an accurate and convenient web server
      for biologists to obtain the results of their analysis of a
      given m{R}{N}{A} sequence. RiboSW is now available on the
      web at .}}

      as covariance models (CMs), Riboswitch finder, and RibEx,
      provide a web server for efficiently searching homologous
      instances of known riboswitches or considers two crucial
      characteristics of each riboswitch, such as the structural
      conformations and sequence contexts of functional regions.
      Therefore, we developed a systematic method for identifying
      12 kinds of riboswitches. The method is implemented and
      provided as a web server, RiboSW, to efficiently and
      conveniently identify riboswitches within messenger
      {R}{N}{A} sequences. The predictive accuracy of the
      proposed method is comparable with other previous tools.
      The efficiency of the proposed method for identifying
      riboswitches was improved in order to achieve a reasonable
      computational time required for the prediction, which makes
      it possible to have an accurate and convenient web server
      for biologists to obtain the results of their analysis of a
      given m{R}{N}{A} sequence. RiboSW is now available on the
      web at .}}

  abstract  = {{BACKGROUND:Riboswitches are a type of noncoding {R}{N}{A}
      that regulate gene expression by switching from one
      structural conformation to another on ligand binding. The
      various classes of riboswitches discovered so far are
      differentiated by the ligand, which on binding induces a
      conformational switch. Every class of riboswitch is
      characterized by an aptamer domain, which provides the site
      for ligand binding, and an expression platform that
      undergoes conformational change on ligand binding. The
      sequence and structure of the aptamer domain is highly
      conserved in riboswitches belonging to the same class. We
      propose a method for fast and accurate identification of
      riboswitches using profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMM). Our
      method exploits the high degree of sequence conservation
      that characterizes the aptamer domain.RESULTS:Our method
      can detect riboswitches in genomic databases rapidly and
      accurately. Its sensitivity is comparable to the method
      based on the Covariance Model (CM). For six out of ten
      riboswitch classes, our method detects more than 99.5\% of
      the candidates identified by the much slower CM method
      while being several hundred times faster. For three
      riboswitch classes, our method detects 97-99 of the
      candidates relative to the CM method. Our method works very
      well for those classes of riboswitches that are
      characterized by distinct and conserved sequence
      motifs.CONCLUSION:Riboswitches play a crucial role in
      controlling the expression of several prokaryotic genes
      involved in metabolism and transport processes. As more and
      more new classes of riboswitches are being discovered, it
      is important to understand the patterns of their intra and
      inter genomic distribution. Understanding such patterns
      will enable us to better understand the evolutionary
      history of these genetic regulatory elements. However, a
      complete picture of the distribution pattern of
      riboswitches will emerge only after accurate identification
      of riboswitches across genomes. We believe that the
      riboswitch detection method developed in this paper will
      aid in that process. The significant advantage in terms of
      speed, of our pHMM-based approach over the method based on
      CM allows us to scan entire databases (rather than 5'UTRs
      only) in a relatively short period of time in order to
      accurately identify riboswitch candidates.}}

  abstract  = {{BACKGROUND:Riboswitches are a type of noncoding {R}{N}{A}
      that regulate gene expression by switching from one
      structural conformation to another on ligand binding. The
      various classes of riboswitches discovered so far are
      differentiated by the ligand, which on binding induces a
      conformational switch. Every class of riboswitch is
      characterized by an aptamer domain, which provides the site
      for ligand binding, and an expression platform that
      undergoes conformational change on ligand binding. The
      sequence and structure of the aptamer domain is highly
      conserved in riboswitches belonging to the same class. We
      propose a method for fast and accurate identification of
      riboswitches using profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMM). Our
      method exploits the high degree of sequence conservation
      that characterizes the aptamer domain.RESULTS:Our method
      can detect riboswitches in genomic databases rapidly and
      accurately. Its sensitivity is comparable to the method
      based on the Covariance Model (CM). For six out of ten
      riboswitch classes, our method detects more than 99.5\% of
      the candidates identified by the much slower CM method
      while being several hundred times faster. For three
      riboswitch classes, our method detects 97-99 of the
      candidates relative to the CM method. Our method works very
      well for those classes of riboswitches that are
      characterized by distinct and conserved sequence
      motifs.CONCLUSION:Riboswitches play a crucial role in
      controlling the expression of several prokaryotic genes
      involved in metabolism and transport processes. As more and
      more new classes of riboswitches are being discovered, it
      is important to understand the patterns of their intra and
      inter genomic distribution. Understanding such patterns
      will enable us to better understand the evolutionary
      history of these genetic regulatory elements. However, a
      complete picture of the distribution pattern of
      riboswitches will emerge only after accurate identification
      of riboswitches across genomes. We believe that the
      riboswitch detection method developed in this paper will
      aid in that process. The significant advantage in terms of
      speed, of our pHMM-based approach over the method based on
      CM allows us to scan entire databases (rather than 5'UTRs
      only) in a relatively short period of time in order to
      accurately identify riboswitch candidates.}}

  annote  = {CMfinder is an EM algorithm using covariance models for
      motif description.

      The basic idea of CMfinder is to use a CM to model an RNA
      motif, a finite mixture model to describe motif
      distribution in sequences, and an EM framework to search
      the motif space.

      Motivated by MEME and COVE.

      Alignment Generation: - Identify subsequences (candidates)
      that minimize MFE / subseq. len. - Use tree-edit distance
      as a metric to compare candidates (Hofacker 1994) - Only
      align candidates (consider with the tree-edit above) if
      they are compatible with locally conserved regions found by
      BLAST - Construct initial alignment by selecting a central
      concensus condidate, and then align it to its best match in
      each sequence - Repeat 10 times to generate the initial 10
      seed alignments

      Alignment Refinement: - Aim is to find finite mixture model
      (FMM) that maximizes log-likelihood

      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm

      They
      consider both the mutual information (definition below) and
      b.p. probability from a thermodynamic model

      One applies Bayes' theorem, multiplying the prior by the
      likelihood function and then normalizing, to get the
      posterior probability distribution, which is the
      conditional distribution of the uncertain quantity given
      the data.

      Mutual Information: I(X, Y) = sum_x { sum_y { p(x, y) *
      log(p(x, y) / (p(x) * p(y))) } }

      I(X, Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X, Y) [where H is Shannon
      entropy: H(X) = -1 * sum_x { p(x) * log(p(x)) }]

      H(X, Y) = -1 * sum_x { sum_y { p(x, y) * log(p(x, y)) } }

      In statistics, an expectation{\textendash}maximization (EM)
      algorithm is an iterative method for finding maximum
      likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of
      parameters in statistical models, where the model depends
      on unobserved latent variables. The EM iteration alternates
      between performing an expectation (E) step, which creates a
      function for the expectation of the log-likelihood
      evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters,
      and a maximization (M) step, which computes parameters
      maximizing the expected log-likelihood found on the E step.
      These parameter-estimates are then used to determine the
      distribution of the latent variables in the next E step.}
