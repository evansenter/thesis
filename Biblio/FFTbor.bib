  be obtained with a click and submitted to NCBI's BLAST. Alternatively, the
  genome context of all other genes regulated by the same element can be
  explored with our genome context tool (GeConT). RibEx is available at

  elements within a specific m{R}{N}{A} that can regulate both transcription
  and translation by interacting with their corresponding metabolites.
  Recently, an increasing number of riboswitches have been identified in
  different species and investigated for their roles in regulatory functions.
  Both the sequence contexts and structural conformations are important
  characteristics of riboswitches. None of the previously developed tools, such
  as covariance models (CMs), Riboswitch finder, and RibEx, provide a web
  server for efficiently searching homologous instances of known riboswitches
  or considers two crucial characteristics of each riboswitch, such as the
  structural conformations and sequence contexts of functional regions.
  Therefore, we developed a systematic method for identifying 12 kinds of
  riboswitches. The method is implemented and provided as a web server, RiboSW,
  to efficiently and conveniently identify riboswitches within messenger
  {R}{N}{A} sequences. The predictive accuracy of the proposed method is
  comparable with other previous tools. The efficiency of the proposed method
  for identifying riboswitches was improved in order to achieve a reasonable
  computational time required for the prediction, which makes it possible to
  have an accurate and convenient web server for biologists to obtain the
  results of their analysis of a given m{R}{N}{A} sequence. RiboSW is now
  available on the web at .}}

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Riboswitches are a type of noncoding {R}{N}{A} that
  regulate gene expression by switching from one structural conformation to
  another on ligand binding. The various classes of riboswitches discovered so
  far are differentiated by the ligand, which on binding induces a
  conformational switch. Every class of riboswitch is characterized by an
  aptamer domain, which provides the site for ligand binding, and an expression
  platform that undergoes conformational change on ligand binding. The sequence
  and structure of the aptamer domain is highly conserved in riboswitches
  belonging to the same class. We propose a method for fast and accurate
  identification of riboswitches using profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMM). Our
  method exploits the high degree of sequence conservation that characterizes
  the aptamer domain.RESULTS:Our method can detect riboswitches in genomic
  databases rapidly and accurately. Its sensitivity is comparable to the method
  based on the Covariance Model (CM). For six out of ten riboswitch classes,
  our method detects more than 99.5\% of the candidates identified by the much
  slower CM method while being several hundred times faster. For three
  riboswitch classes, our method detects 97-99 of the candidates relative to
  the CM method. Our method works very well for those classes of riboswitches
  that are characterized by distinct and conserved sequence
  motifs.CONCLUSION:Riboswitches play a crucial role in controlling the
  expression of several prokaryotic genes involved in metabolism and transport
  processes. As more and more new classes of riboswitches are being discovered,
  it is important to understand the patterns of their intra and inter genomic
  distribution. Understanding such patterns will enable us to better understand
  the evolutionary history of these genetic regulatory elements. However, a
  complete picture of the distribution pattern of riboswitches will emerge only
  after accurate identification of riboswitches across genomes. We believe that
  the riboswitch detection method developed in this paper will aid in that
  process. The significant advantage in terms of speed, of our pHMM-based
  approach over the method based on CM allows us to scan entire databases
  (rather than 5'UTRs only) in a relatively short period of time in order to
  accurately identify riboswitch candidates.}}
